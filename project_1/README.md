The Marvel Character Resource uses the Marvel api (https://developer.marvel.com/) to pull data about your favorite marvel characters.  To get started users can search by character name in the text box. A suggested character button is provided that when clicked will give a sample list of characters to try.  When the user types in the character name and hits submit, the characters thumbnail image is displayed along with a short bio of the character.   3 additional buttons will also appear adding additional functionality as follows.

Series Featured - Will display the first 20 comic series that feature the character. (Some characters have as manay as 4000!)

Events Featuring - A list of significant events the character was featured in.  

Add to team - Build a team of your  favorite characters.  I hope to do more with this in the future.

Techologies - used Ajax calls to marvel api.  Jquery - dom manipulation, event listeners. 

Unsolved Problems - 
Not all characters have a bio listed in the data returned by Marvel api.  I discovered this late into the project as i was testing with 2 or 3.  Not sure if this is temporary on Marvels part or not
Looking into different ways to display the large amount of series available for some characters.  
Adding additional features via the api to expand beyond just characters.  
Fix My team section bug to always remain on screen even for new character submit.
